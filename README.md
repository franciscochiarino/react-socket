# React Socket âš¡ðŸ”Œ

I created this project to learn about creating card games for two players. I don't have any game in mind yet. Ideally the playaers would be able to draw cards (from the top or bottom), shuffle and maybe skip turns or something like that. It's called react-scoket because I'm using socket.io to make communication between two computers possible. This is actually the reason I find all of this interesting.

Further along I would like to use Firebase to setup a quick database, but that's for another day.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:franciscochiarino/react-socket.git
```

Inside this project there are two directories: client and server. On both of them you have to run:

```
npm i
npm start
```

Replace `npm` for `yarn` if you're using yarn.
